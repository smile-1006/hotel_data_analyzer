# Hotel Data Analyzer

## üìå Overview
The **Hotel Data Analyzer** is an AI-powered system that processes hotel booking data, extracts insights, and enables retrieval-augmented question answering (RAG). The system provides analytics on revenue trends, cancellations, geographical distribution, and booking lead times, making data-driven decision-making more efficient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handles missing values, formats inconsistencies, and structures data efficiently.
- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Cancellation rate as a percentage of total bookings
  - Geographical distribution of users
  - Booking lead time distribution
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
  - Utilizes FAISS/ChromaDB for storing vector embeddings.
  - Integrates an open-source LLM (Llama 2, Falcon, GPT-Neo, Mistral) for natural language Q&A.
  - Enables users to ask booking-related questions like:
    - "What was the total revenue for July 2017?"
    - "Which locations had the highest booking cancellations?"
    - "What is the average price of a hotel booking?"
- **REST API for Seamless Interaction**
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast query retrieval with API response optimization.
- **Optional Enhancements**: Real-time data updates, query history tracking.

## ü§ñ How RAG is Implemented
- Data Storage: Booking records are embedded and stored in a **vector database** (FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate).
- Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the system retrieves relevant booking data using vector similarity search.
- LLM Integration: An open-source LLM processes the retrieved data to generate a contextual answer.
